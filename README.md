# Modelling the Roles of Antibody Titre and Avidity in Protection from Malaria Infection Following RTS,S/AS01 Vaccination 

## Contents 

## Overview 

Identifiying vaccine induced correlates of protection often relies on testing statical associations and large sample sizes. However during early clinical trials of malaria vaccine candidates human challenge studies are used and the sample sizes are relatively small which can often make statical tests difficult. In this work we use a Baysian method to fit a biologically motivated mathematical model of individal level malaria infection to characterise the relationships between antibody titre and antibody avidty and protection from infection following vaccination.  
This model structure allows us to take into account individuals protection status and their time to onset of parasitaemia in the same model
